\lipsum[1].

\subsection{What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for?}

\lipsum[1]

\subsection{Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses? \subtitle{For example, is there anything that a dataset consumer might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality of service issues) or other risks or harms (e.g., legal risks, financial harms)?

\lipsum[1]

\subsection{Any other comments?}

\lipsum[1]

\section{Composition}

\subsection{What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent? \subtitle{For example: documents, photos, people, or companies}}

\lipsum[1]

\subsection{Are there multiple types of instances? \subtitle{e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges. Please provide a description.}}

\lipsum[1]

\subsection{How many instances are there in total? \subtitle{Of each type, if appropriate.}}

\lipsum[1]

\subsection{Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? \subtitle{If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable)}}

\lipsum[1]

\subsection{What data does each instance consist of?}

\lipsum[1]

\subsection{Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description. Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (e.g., users’ movie ratings, social network links)? \subtitle{If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit}}

\lipsum[1]

\subsection{Are there recommended data splits (e.g., training, development/validation, testing)? \subtitle{If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.}}

\lipsum[1]

\subsection{Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? \subtitle{If so, please provide a description.}}

\lipsum[1]

\subsection{Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources? \subtitle{For example: websites, tweets, other datasets)}}

\lipsum[1]

\subsection{Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential? \subtitle{For example: data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor–patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals’ nonpublic communications. If so, please provide a description.}}

\lipsum[1]

\subsection{Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? \subtitle{If so, please describe why.}}

\lipsum[1]

\subsection{Does the dataset identify any subpopulations (e.g., by age, gender)? \subtitle{If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.}}

\lipsum[1]

\subsection{Is it possible to identify individuals (i.e., one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (i.e., in combination with other data) from the dataset? \subtitle{If so, please describe how.}}

\lipsum[1]

\subsection{Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way? \subtitle{For example: data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history) If so, please provide a description.}}

\lipsum[1]

\subsection{Any other comments?}

\lipsum[1]

\section{Collection Process}

\subsection{How was the data associated with each instance acquired?}

\lipsum[1]

\subsection{Was the data directly observable (e.g., raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (e.g., survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (e.g., part-of-speech tags)? \subtitle{If the data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.}}

\lipsum[1]

\subsection{Who was involved in the data collection process and how were they compensated?}

\lipsum[1]

\subsection{Over what timeframe was the data collected? Does this timeframe match the creation timeframe of the data associated with the instances (e.g., recent crawl of old news articles)? \subtitle{If not, please describe the timeframe in which the data associated with the instances was created.}}

\lipsum[1]

\subsection{Were any ethical review processes conducted (e.g., by an institutional review board)? \subtitle{If so, please provide a description of these review processes, including the outcomes, as well as a link or other access point to any supporting documentation.}}

\lipsum[1]

\subsection{Did you collect the data from the individuals in question directly, or obtain it via third parties or other sources (e.g., websites)?}

\lipsum[1]

\subsection{Were the individuals in question notified about the data collection? \subtitle{If so, please describe (or show with screenshots or other information) how notice was provided, and provide a link or other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, the exact language of the notification itself. Did the individuals in question consent to the collection and use of their data? If so, please describe (or show with screenshots or other information) how consent was requested and provided, and provide a link or other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, the exact language to which the individuals consented. No (see previous question).}}
